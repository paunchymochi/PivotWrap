## About

The pivot table is arguably Excel's most powerful tool. It can summarize so much data in so little time with no more than a few clicks and drags. But creating and controlling one using VBA is a different story. The amount of boilerplate required to build the simplest of pivot tables is mind-bloggling. If you're an Excel power user who enjoy writing code from scratch to interact with pivot tables in your VBA projects, then you're probably the only one out there, end if.

PivotWrap is a set of VBA class modules that streamlines the pivot table coding experience for greater productivity. It takes care of the boilerplates for you so you can focus on building pivot tables of all complexities using concise, intuitive class methods.
